## Installation
To install and run the app, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Flutter 3.22.1 installed. You can use FVM to manage the Flutter version.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
4. Use `flutter run` to launch the app on your device or emulator.

## Usage
To play the game, simply launch the app and start a new game. Players take turns marking a square on the 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
